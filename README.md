# MobileNet on iOS

This application processes frames from the camera with the pre-trained MobileNet in Vision/CoreML framework in real time.

Known issue: It does not update the label (bug in iOS 11?)

It copied the model file from [hollance/MobileNet-CoreML](https://github.com/hollance/MobileNet-CoreML), which is originated from [shicai/MobileNet-Caffe](https://github.com/shicai/MobileNet-Caffe).

MobileNet-Caffer is a Caffe implementation of Google's MobileNets, which are built in TensorFlow.
